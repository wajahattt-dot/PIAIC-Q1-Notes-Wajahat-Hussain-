## 📝 Topics Covered

### 1. 🚀 Introduction to ChatGPT (Strawberry Project)
- Overview of five levels of AI, focusing on chatbots and agents.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: 🧠 Learning by interacting with the environment and receiving rewards.
    - **Example**: A robot 🤖 receives a command, performs an action, and is rewarded for achieving its goal 🏆.

### 2. 🧵 String Data Type
- **Shallow Copy vs. Deep Copy**:
  - Shallow copy 🔗: Copies the reference.
  - Deep copy 📦: Copies the object.
  
- **Common String Escape Characters**:
  - `\\` ➡️ for escape.
  - `\n` ➡️ for newline.
  - `\t` ➡️ for tab.

### 3. 📊 Displaying Data
- `display(data)`: Shows data in its raw form.
- `print(data)`: Displays data in a user-friendly format.

---

### 4. 🔄 Type Casting
- Convert one data type to another.
  - Example: `str(10)` converts an integer to a string.
- **Placeholders**:

### 5. 🧮 Python Operators

#### 1. ➕ Arithmetic Operators
- Addition: `a + b`
- Subtraction: `a - b`
- Multiplication: `a * b`
- Division: `a / b` (returns a float 🌊)
- Floor Division: `a // b` (returns an integer 🔢)
- Modulus: `a % b` (remainder ➗)
- Exponent: `a ** b` (power ⚡)

#### 2. ❓ Comparison Operators (Boolean Results: True/False)
- Equal to: `a == b`
- Not equal to: `a != b`
- Greater than: `a > b`
- Less than: `a < b`
- Greater than or equal to: `a >= b`
- Less than or equal to: `a <= b`

#### 3. 📝 Assignment Operators
- Assign value: `a = 10`
- Add and assign: `a += 5`
- Subtract and assign: `a -= 5`
- Multiply and assign: `a *= 5`
- Divide and assign: `a /= 5`

#### 4. ⚖️ Logical Operators
- AND: `x and y`
- OR: `x or y`
- NOT: `not x`

#### 5. 🔍 Membership Operators
- `in`: `x in list`
- `not in`: `x not in list`

#### 6. 🆔 Identity Operators
- `is`: `x is y` (same object)
- `is not`: `x is not y`
