# PIAIC Sunday Class 08 - 15th September 2024

## Instructor
**Wajahat Hussain**

## Topics Covered

### 1. Introduction to ChatGPT (Strawberry Project)
- Overview of five levels of AI with a focus on chatbots and agents.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Learning where an agent interacts with the environment and learns based on rewards. 
    - **Example**: A robot receives a command, performs an action, and is rewarded for reaching a goal.

### 2. String Data Type
- **Shallow Copy vs. Deep Copy**:
  - Shallow copy copies the reference.
  - Deep copy copies the object.
  
- **Common String Escape Characters**:
  - `\\` for escape.
  - `\n` for newline.
  - `\t` for tab.

### 3. Displaying Data
- `display(data)`: Shows data in raw form.
- `print(data)`: Displays data in user-friendly form.

### 4. Type Casting
- Converting one data type to another.
  - Example: `str(10)` converts an integer to a string.
- **Placeholders**:
  - `%s` for strings.
  - `%d` for integers.

### 5. Python Operators

#### 1. Arithmetic Operators
- Addition: `a + b`
- Subtraction: `a - b`
- Multiplication: `a * b`
- Division: `a / b` (returns a float)
- Floor Division: `a // b` (returns an integer)
- Modulus: `a % b` (remainder)
- Exponent: `a ** b` (power)

#### 2. Comparison Operators (Boolean Results: True/False)
- Equal to: `a == b`
- Not equal to: `a != b`
- Greater than: `a > b`
- Less than: `a < b`
- Greater than or equal to: `a >= b`
- Less than or equal to: `a <= b`

#### 3. Assignment Operators
- Assign value: `a = 10`
- Add and assign: `a += 5`
- Subtract and assign: `a -= 5`
- Multiply and assign: `a *= 5`
- Divide and assign: `a /= 5`

#### 4. Logical Operators
- AND: `x and y`
- OR: `x or y`
- NOT: `not x`

#### 5. Membership Operators
- `in`: `x in list`
- `not in`: `x not in list`

#### 6. Identity Operators
- `is`: `x is y` (same object)
- `is not`: `x is not y`
