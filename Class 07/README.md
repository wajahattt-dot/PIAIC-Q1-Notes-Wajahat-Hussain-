# üßë‚Äçüè´ PIAIC Sunday Class 07 - September 8th, 2024

## Instructor: Wajahat Hussain üåü

Welcome to **PIAIC Class 07**, held at the **Bahria Auditorium** on **September 8th, 2024**. During this session, we explored the incredible capabilities of **Google Colab**, diving into its powerful features, interface, and how to leverage it for machine learning and Python programming tasks.

For all the code examples in this class, you can refer directly to the **[Class 07 Code File](./Class_07_Code_File.ipynb)**, which contains all the Python programs, commands, and scripts discussed during the session. üöÄ

## üöÄ Why Use Google Colab?

**Google Colab** is a cloud-based platform that makes coding easier and faster. Here are some of the **amazing benefits** of using Colab:

1. **No Local Errors** üîß: Since Google Colab runs in the cloud, you won‚Äôt face issues caused by your local hardware or system configuration. This eliminates the headache of troubleshooting local errors.
2. **Virtual Computing Environment** üíª: You don‚Äôt need a super-powerful computer to perform high-end computations! Google Colab provides a free virtual machine to run your code.
3. **16 GB VRAM** üñ•Ô∏è: Colab provides access to powerful hardware, including GPUs with up to **16 GB of VRAM** for demanding tasks like machine learning or deep learning. Perfect for AI enthusiasts! ü§ñ
4. **1 GB/s Network Speed** ‚ö°: Fast internet speeds allow you to download large datasets or interact with APIs without delay.
5. **Python Pre-installed** üêç: Python comes pre-installed, so there‚Äôs no need to install any packages or set up your environment manually. You‚Äôre ready to code as soon as you open Colab.
6. **Colab Pro and Colab Pro+** üíº: 
   - **Colab Pro** ($9.99/month): Gives access to better hardware, faster GPUs, and longer runtimes.
   - **Colab Pro+** ($49.99/month): Provides even **faster GPUs** and more memory for those working with large datasets and more complex machine learning models.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features of the Google Colab Interface

We took a tour of **Google Colab‚Äôs interface** to understand its layout and the features available. Here's a detailed look at what we discussed:

1. **Play Button** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è: This button is used to execute the code within a specific cell.
2. **+Code Button** ‚ûï: Adds a new code cell to your notebook where you can write your Python code.
3. **Generate with AI** ü§ñ: A cutting-edge feature that helps generate code snippets using **AI assistance**. Super useful when you're stuck or need help creating complex code!
4. **Creating a New Notebook** üìù: You can create a new notebook in two ways:
   - Navigate to **File > New Notebook** within Colab.
   - Or, in Google Drive, click **New > More > Google Colaboratory** to create a new notebook directly.

## üñ•Ô∏è Google Colab‚Äôs Interface Components

Once you've created a notebook, the interface is organized into several essential sections:

1. **Menu Bar**: This section contains options for saving, editing, running, and managing your notebook.
2. **Toolbar**: Allows you to add or delete cells, run your entire notebook, or stop code execution if something goes wrong. ‚õî
3. **Notebook Cells**: These are where you write and execute your Python code or add text. You can also use **Markdown** to format your text with headers, links, and more.

## ‚ö° Accelerate Your Tasks with GPU/TPU

We also explored how to accelerate your deep learning tasks by enabling **GPUs** (Graphics Processing Units) or **TPUs** (Tensor Processing Units). This is crucial for machine learning models that require a lot of computational power.

### Steps to Enable GPU/TPU:

1. Go to **Runtime > Change runtime type**.
2. In the **Hardware accelerator** dropdown, select **GPU** or **TPU**.
3. Click **Save**.
4. Check if your environment has access to a GPU by running this Python code (see the code [here](./Class_07_Code_File.ipynb)).

## üíª Writing Your First Python Program - ‚ÄúHello Wizard‚Äù

We wrote a simple Python program during class:

```python
print("hello wizard")
