# üåü PIAIC Sunday Class 2 - Instructor: Wajahat Hussain

Welcome to the official repository for **PIAIC Sunday Class 2** held on **July 28, 2024**. This class focused on fundamental concepts for developing cloud-native applications and the integration of APIs with cutting-edge technologies like GPTs. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this repository will guide you through essential topics in API development, cloud technologies, and more!

## üìö Topics Covered

1. **Business and API Development**  
   - We explored how businesses today are powered by APIs, allowing different software applications to communicate seamlessly.  
   - We worked specifically with **Python** as the primary language for building APIs.  
   - Learn more about APIs: [What is an API?](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/api)

2. **Cloud Technologies**  
   - The class introduced how to host applications in the **cloud**, allowing global access and ensuring your software is available online, anytime, anywhere. üåç  
   - Interested in cloud? Check out: [AWS Cloud Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)

3. **Frontend Development**  
   - We covered the concept of the **frontend**, which is the client side of applications. Whether it's a mobile app, a **Conversational User Interface (CUI)** like chatbots, or a web app, the frontend is what users interact with.  
   - Tools we use: **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**.  
   - Learn more about front-end dev: [Frontend Development Guide](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2019/)

4. **Human Cloud Interaction (HCI)**  
   - The role of **Public Dealing Officer HCI** was discussed, which involves managing and interacting with cloud-based applications that users rely on.  

5. **Custom GPTs & APIs**  
   - **APIs** can be linked to **Custom GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers)**, allowing developers to create AI-powered applications tailored to specific tasks.  
   - We discussed how to use **OpenAPI specs** to standardize and describe APIs for easier integration and development.  
   - Build your own GPT app: [OpenAI GPT](https://beta.openai.com/)

6. **Quotients**  
   - üß† **AQ (Action Quotient)**: Measures the ability to take action, as we learned through Sir Ameen's example of building a custom GPT for **Exam Master**.  
   - üòä **EQ (Emotional Quotient)**: Refers to emotional intelligence and how it's measured in tech.  
   - üß† **IQ (Intelligence Quotient)**: Measures intellectual abilities, helping us understand cognitive performance.

7. **Prompt Engineering**  
   - We dived deep into **prompt engineering**, a technique used to optimize prompts for interacting with **AI models** like GPTs.  
   - Learn prompt engineering: [Prompt Engineering Best Practices](https://openai.com/blog/prompt-engineering)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Tools and Technologies Used:
- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**: Run Linux commands directly on Windows for seamless development.  
  Get started with WSL: [Installation Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

- **Docker Desktop**: The ultimate tool for creating and managing containers, allowing you to run your apps in isolated environments.  
  Download Docker: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

- **VS Code**: A popular code editor with great extensions and plugins to make coding efficient.  
  Download VS Code: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

- **Python**: Our primary language for building APIs and cloud-native applications.  
  Download Python: [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- **Ubuntu Image for Docker**: A Linux distribution used in Docker containers to create an isolated development environment.  
  Get it from Docker Hub: [Ubuntu Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu)

### üöÄ Class Activity: Installing Ubuntu and Writing "Hello World"  
We walked through the steps of installing **Ubuntu** on WSL and ran our first **"Hello World"** program. Check out our GitHub repo for full instructions: [Learn Cloud Native Modern Python](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-cloud-native-modern-python/linux)
