## 🧠 Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is key to generating accurate and meaningful outputs from AI models like ChatGPT. Here are some best practices:

1. **Include Details in Your Query**: 
   - The more specific you are, the better the model can respond. For example:
     ```bash
     Explain how cloud-native microservices work.
     ```

2. **Ask the Model to Adopt a Persona**: 
   - You can request the model to assume roles like a teacher, expert, or advisor. For example:
     ```bash
     Act as a cloud computing professor and explain microservices.
     ```

3. **Use Delimiters for Clarity**:
   - Add delimiters (e.g., quotes or brackets) to clearly define sections in your input.
     ```
     "Explain the importance of cloud computing."
     ```

4. **Specify Task Steps**: 
   - Lay out steps to ensure the model follows a structured process.

5. **Provide Examples**: 
   - Guide the model by adding sample outputs for reference. 

6. **Specify Desired Length**: 
   - Control the length of your output by mentioning whether you want a short, medium, or detailed response.

> *💡 Remember: A clear prompt ensures a clear response!*

## 🔗 Chain of Thought
We explored the **Chain of Thought** method to refine problem-solving:

- **Steps Definition**: Define each step to follow.
- **Brainstorming**: Generate as many ideas as possible.
- **Mind Mapping**: Create a visual representation of the relationships between concepts and ideas.

## 🎯 Few-Shot Prompting
Few-shot prompting helps you set the right expectations for AI-generated responses by providing a few examples. It’s especially useful for summarizing job descriptions or field-specific tasks:

```markdown
Example:
- Prompt: "Summarize the role of a Cloud Engineer."
- Expected output: "A Cloud Engineer designs and manages cloud computing infrastructures..."
```

### 🛠️ Basic Commands
We practiced a few Linux commands that every developer should know! Below are some basics:
| Command              | Description                                       |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `echo "hello world"`  | Prints "hello world" to the screen.               |
| `ls`                 | Lists all files and folders in the current directory. |
| `cd /`               | Changes the current directory to the root directory. |
| `mkdir [directory_name]` | Creates a new directory with the specified name. |
| `pwd`                | Displays the current directory path.              |
| `cd code`            | Changes the directory to a folder named "code."   |

### Command	Description
`echo "hello world"`	Prints "hello world" to the screen.
`ls`	Lists all files and folders in the current directory.
`cd /`	Changes the current directory to the root directory.
`mkdir [directory_name]`	Creates a new directory with the specified name.
`pwd`	Displays the current directory path.
`cd code`	Changes the directory to a folder named "code."

## 🐳 Docker: Hello World
We also explored Docker basics by running the famous "Hello World" container. You can pull and run the Hello World image with:
```
docker run hello-world
```

### 🔗 Explore Docker Images:

Docker Hub
🌟 Tip: Docker simplifies containerizing applications and managing them in the cloud.

## 🌐 Path Types
Understanding file paths is essential when working in a Linux environment:

### Absolute Path:
A complete path starting from the root directory. Example: /home/user/documents

### Relative Path:
A path that is relative to the current directory. Example: documents (when you're already in /home/user/).
